# The program should begin by reading user input on the meal cost. Then the program calculates VAT and
# tip for the meal. Tax rate should be taken as 16% of meal cost.
# The tip is 10% of the meal cost (without the tax). The output should show
#  the tax amount, the tip amount, and total cost in separate lines.
# Format the output so that all of the values
# are displayed using two decimal places.


# Read the cost of the meal from the user
cost = float(input("Enter the cost of the meal: "))

# Compute the VAT
VAT = 0.16 * cost
# Compute the tip
tip = 0.10 * cost

total_cost = cost + VAT + tip

# Display the VAT, tip, and total cost.
# The %.2f format specifier indicates that value should have 2 digits to the right of the decimal point.
print("The VAT is Kes%.2f" % VAT)
print("The tip is Kes%.2f" % tip)
print("The total cost is Kes%.2f" % total_cost)
