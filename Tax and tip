# The program that you create for this exercise will begin by reading the cost of a meal
# ordered at a restaurant from the user. Then your program will compute the tax and
# tip for the meal. Use your local tax rate when computing the amount of tax owing.
# Compute the tip as 10 percent of the meal amount (without the tax). The output from
# your program should include the tax amount, the tip amount, and the grand total for
# the meal including both the tax and the tip. Format the output so that all of the values
# are displayed using two decimal places.


# Read the cost of the meal from the user
cost = float(input("Enter the cost of the meal: "))

# Compute the VAT
VAT = 0.16 * cost
# Compute the tip
tip = 0.10 * cost

total_cost = cost + VAT + tip

# Display the VAT, tip, and total cost.
# The %.2f format specifier indicates that value should have 2 digits to the right of the decimal point.
print("The VAT is Kes%.2f" % VAT)
print("The tip is Kes%.2f" % tip)
print("The total cost is Kes%.2f" % total_cost)
